After developing some little Emacs packages for a year or so, I began to notice how I'd forget little things that I learned, and then I'd have to go hunting for that information again.  I also noticed how there are some issues for which there doesn't seem to be a "best practice" or "Standard Operating Procedure" to refer to.

So this is intended to be a place to collect and organize information related to Emacs package development.  Built with Emacs, by Emacs package developers, for Emacs package developers.

You can read this Org file directly on the [[https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-package-dev-handbook][repository]], or you can read the [[https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/][HTML version]].

This may actually be a bug, or at least an unanswered question.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/63u5yn/how_to_use_autoload_cookies_for_custom_defunlike/][How to use autoload cookies for custom defun-like macros? : emacs]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Say I have a macro =deffoo= that expands to some custom kind of =defun=, and I want to use an autoload cookie to autoload the result. According to the manual,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;;;###autoload (deffoo bar   ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

copies the entire form to =autoloads.el=, and something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;;;###autoload (autoload 'bar "this-file") (deffoo bar   ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

should be used instead. What confuses me is [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/38805102][this StackOverflow comment]] by who appears to be Stefan Monnier, saying that Emacs /should/ expand the macro before generating the autoload, and that it's probably a bug when this does not happen.

Can anyone clear up what the intended behaviour is?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Pattern matching is invaluable in elisp. Lists are ubiquitous, and a small amount of pattern matching can often replace a ton of verbose list fiddling.

Since this is Lisp, we have lots of choices! In this post, we'll compare [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/cl.html][cl.el]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Pattern-matching-case-statement.html][pcase.el]], [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]], and [[https://github.com/VincentToups/shadchen-el][shadchen]], so you can choose the best fit for your project. We'll look at the most common use cases, and end with some recommendations.

For the sake of this post, we'll consider both pattern matching and destructuring, as they're closely related concepts.

Dash is a powerful library, and one of its features is powerful destructuring with its ~-let~ macro, and several others that work the same way.

let-alist is the best thing to happen to associative lists since the invention of the cons cell. This little macro lets you easily access the contents of an alist, concisely and efficiently, without having to specify them preemptively. It comes built-in with 25.1, and is also available on GNU Elpa for older Emacsen.

This bookmarklet should provide a way to get the URL:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  javascript:void(open('https://archive.today/?run=1&url='+encodeURIComponent(document.location)))
#+END_SRC

Seems to only work if run in a browser, with JavaScript.  But there's a [[https://github.com/pastpages/archiveis][Python package]] that has a shell command.  So:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (require 's)

  (defun emacs-package-dev-handbook--archiveis-capture (url)
    "Return archive.is archived URL for URL."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (when (zerop (call-process "archiveis" nil t nil url))
        (s-trim (buffer-string)))))

  (cl-defun emacs-package-dev-handbook-insert-archiveis-property (&optional url)
    "Set the \"archive.is\" property for entry at point to the archived URL.
  Assumes heading on/before point is an Org link to a web page.  If
  URL is given, archive that URL instead."
    (interactive)
    (when-let ((url (or url (save-excursion
                              (unless (org-at-heading-p)
                                (org-back-to-heading))
                              (when (re-search-forward org-bracket-link-regexp (line-end-position) 'noerror)
                                (org-link-unescape (match-string-no-properties 1))))))
               (archive-url (emacs-package-dev-handbook--archiveis-capture url)))
      (org-set-property "archive.is" archive-url)))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Insert new entry at point

Maybe use capture templates and refile?

** Table of Contents

Currently using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc][org-make-toc]], which is uploaded but unfinished and unpackaged.

** Config

I love Emacs and Org mode.  This makes it so easy to make the document...alive!  And automated!  Beautiful.
